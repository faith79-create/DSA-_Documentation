#### I started this journeyy with the DSA Incubator Hub.
I learnt quite lots of things like:
- Microsoft Excel

# ðŸ§  What I Learned
This project helped me deepen my skills in:

- Building fully functional, multi-page dashboards
- Applying DAX formulas to calculate and aggregate metrics
- Creating filterable visual experiences for end users
- Turning messy, real-life-like data into a structured, insightful product
- Understanding how HR teams can use data to drive strategic decision-making
This project was completed as part of my training at The Incubator Hub, a talent accelerator focused on building real-world data skills through hands-on, practical tasks. The program emphasized:
